        Exec_retry_time means the total duration of the first two executions.
        The duration of the last execution is Query_time minus Exec_retry_time.

    - name: Process_time
      type: double
      description: >
        The total processing time of a SQL statement in TiKV.
        Because data is sent to TiKV concurrently, this value might exceed Query_time.
    - name: Wait_time
      type: double
      description: >
        The total waiting time of a statement in TiKV.
        Because the Coprocessor of TiKV runs a limited number of threads,
        requests might queue up when all threads of Coprocessor are working.
        When a request in the queue takes a long time to process,
        the waiting time of the subsequent requests increases.
    - name: Process_keys

      description: >
        The number of keys that Coprocessor has processed.
        Compared with total_keys, processed_keys does not include the old versions of MVCC.
        A great difference between processed_keys and total_keys indicates that many old versions exist.
