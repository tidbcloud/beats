    # A list of glob-based paths that will be crawled and fetched.
    # All patterns supported by Go Glob are also supported here.
    # For example, to fetch all files from a predefined level of subdirectories,
    # the following pattern can be used: /var/log/*/*.log. This fetches all .log files from the subfolders of /var/log.
    # It does not fetch log files from the /var/log folder itself.
    #var.paths:

    # Set custom input_type environment.
    # Only two options are valid: "log" (which means bare-metal) and "container".
    # If left empty, it will be set to "log" by default.
    #var.input_type:

    input:
      # TiDB server log file might locate in the same path as slow log file.

      # A list of tags that Filebeat includes in the tags field of each published event.
      # Tags make it easy to select specific events in Kibana or apply conditional filtering in Logstash.
      # These tags will be appended to the list of tags specified in the general configuration.

      #  - "tag"

      # Optional fields that you can specify to add additional information to the output.
      # For example, you might add fields that you can use for filtering log data.
      # Fields can be scalar values, arrays, dictionaries, or any nested combination of these.
      # By default, the fields that you specify here will be grouped under a fields sub-dictionary in the output document.
      # To store the custom fields as top-level fields, set the fields_under_root option to true.
      # If a duplicate field is declared in the general configuration, then its value will be overwritten by the value declared here.

      # A list of processors to apply to the input data.
      # These processors will be appended after default processors:
